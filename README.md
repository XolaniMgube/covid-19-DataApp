This is a React App that pulls data from an API.
The API I'm pulling from is free and I'm pulling from 2 end points.

Running the application.
I'm using NPM to run the application there for to be able to run it you need to have node package manager, which you can get installation instructions here: https://www.npmjs.com/


If you want to contribute to this project, after cloning or forking the project you.
(1) Clone or Fork the Repo, yse the terminal to follow the rest of the instructions.
(2) On the root folder, type "npm insta" to install all the node dependencies.
(3) Navigate to the src folder and type "npm start".
(4) Open your browser and make sure you don't have localhost port 3000 occupied because that is wher this project runs.
(5) The UI and UX are pretty simple you will understand how it is written.
